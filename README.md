## üìñ About This Repository

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio ---
an interactive, voice-enabled experience powered by a **custom AI Voice
Assistant** that I created using **Node.js + Express** for the backend
and **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend.

Rather than being just another portfolio website, this project reflects
**my journey, skills, projects, and story in a conversational way**. The
assistant speaks as me (Paritosh Barman), answers questions naturally,
and guides users to explore my background, projects, and career vision.
